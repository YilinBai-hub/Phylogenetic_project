# Phylogenetic_project
 
The project aims to compare the difference between the one-class model ML tree and the mixture-class model for ML tree (ML tree run by IQ-TREE) for different models. 
The used dataset consists of 155 Drosophila genomes and 4 outgroup genomes, spanning over 50 million years of evolution.
